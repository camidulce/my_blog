== README

This was one of the first GA class projects: to build a Ruby on Rails app which has the basic functionality
of a blog: you can add/show/edit/destroy a post and search posts.

Technologies used:
- Ruby on Rails
- HTML/CSS for the front end

This app was the first one I deployed to Heroku: https://evening-tor-8187.herokuapp.com/posts.
